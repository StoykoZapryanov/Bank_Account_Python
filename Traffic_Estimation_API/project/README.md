### Traffic Estimation Process:
By taking the minimum value among the filtered opportunities across different dimensions, we're essentially making a conservative estimate of traffic. This means we're assuming that the actual traffic generated will be limited by the dimension with the lowest opportunity count. It's a cautious approach that ensures we don't overestimate the traffic by considering only the most constrained dimension.

While this method may provide a reasonable estimate under certain conditions, it's important to note that it's a simplification of a more complex process. The actual traffic generated may vary based on factors beyond the opportunities considered, such as user behavior, market dynamics, and external events.

In summary, while the minimum value approach serves as a pragmatic way to estimate traffic based on available opportunities, it's essential to interpret the results with caution and consider other factors that may influence actual traffic levels.

### Project Name: Traffic Estimation API

## Description:
The Traffic Estimation API is designed to estimate web traffic based on opportunities associated with various dimensions such as countries, browsers, platforms, and verticals. It provides a simple HTTP API endpoint /estimate_traffic to receive request parameters and return estimated traffic counts.

## Usage:
The API endpoint /estimate_traffic accepts GET requests with the following parameters:

total_request_count: Total number of requests to estimate traffic for.
browser: List of browser names to filter the opportunities (optional).
platform: List of platform names to filter the opportunities (optional).
vertical: List of vertical names to filter the opportunities (optional).
country: List of country names to filter the opportunities (optional).

## Example Request:
GET /estimate_traffic?total_request_count=1000000&browser=Chrome&platform=Android&vertical=280000000000

## Example Response:
{
    "estimated_traffic": 9918736
}
